I help Flutterwave solve the problem using the following approach
1. created a rave payment account 
2. switched to the test account 
3. make use of the API public key to establish a connection
4. finally create a simple interface that communicates with the API to ensure succesful transaction.

for the sub account 
1. created the sub account on from Rave dashboard specifying the account, name, share, etc.
2. then make use of the account id in my code to ensure the money drops into the account.
